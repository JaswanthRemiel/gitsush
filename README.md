# GitSush - The Sushi Chef for Your Git Repos.

Tired of typing `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` like a peasant?  
Let `gshh` handle your Git workflow like a sushi chef fast, precise, and deliciously efficient!

## Installation
Get your Git sushi roll ready with:

```bash
npm install -g gitsush
```
(Yes, it's `gitsush` but the command is `gshh` because typing extra letters is so 2010.)

## Usage

### Basic Roll (Commit & Push Everything)
```bash
gshh "Your commit message" .
```

### Specialty Roll (Commit & Push Specific Files)
```bash
gshh "Fixed the nasty bug" src/buggyfile.js
```

### Combo Platter (Multiple Files)
```bash
gshh "Updated stuff" "file1.js file2.css utils.py"
```

## Why Use GitSush?

✔ One command to rule them all – No more typing three separate Git commands like a caveman(old).  
✔ Saves your fingers – Fewer keystrokes = more energy for coffee.  
✔ Fun & colorful output – Because terminal logs should be exciting!  
✔ Perfect for lazy devs – Admit it, you’d rather automate everything.

## Real-World Example
```bash
gshh "Made the button less ugly" src/Button.js
```

**Output:**
```
🚀 Preparing to ship your changes...  
✔ Successfully shipped src/Button.js with message: "Made the button less ugly"  
  [main 4d3b33f] Made the button less ugly  
  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)  
```

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Quirks)

**Q: Why "gshh"?**  
A: Because `git-sush` was too long, and `gshh` sounds like you’re telling Git to "shhh, just do it."

**Q: Does it work with branches?**  
A: It pushes to your current branch. If you need more control, maybe learn Git properly. (Just kidding… but not really.)

**Q: What if I mess up?**  
A: Same as regular "Git panic", then `git reset --hard`.
