# 🎉 GitSush - The Sushi Chef for Your Git Repos 🍣

Tired of typing `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` like a peasant?  
Let `gshh` handle your Git workflow like a sushi chef—fast, precise, and deliciously efficient!

## 🚀 Installation
Get your Git sushi roll ready with:

```bash
npm install -g gitsush
```
(Yes, it's `gitsush` but the command is `gshh`—because typing extra letters is so 2010.)

## 🍣 Usage

### Basic Roll (Commit & Push Everything)
```bash
gshh "Your commit message" .
```
_"Here, chef! Do your magic with all my files!"_

### Specialty Roll (Commit & Push Specific Files)
```bash
gshh "Fixed the nasty bug" src/buggyfile.js
```
_"Just this file, chef. Make it perfect."_

### Combo Platter (Multiple Files)
```bash
gshh "Updated stuff" "file1.js file2.css utils.py"
```
_"A little bit of everything, chef. Surprise me!"_

## 🔥 Why Use GitSush?

✔ One command to rule them all – No more typing three separate Git commands like a caveman.  
✔ Saves your fingers – Fewer keystrokes = more energy for coffee.  
✔ Fun & colorful output – Because terminal logs should be exciting!  
✔ Perfect for lazy devs – Admit it, you’d rather automate everything.

## 🍜 Real-World Example

  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)  
```

## 🤔 FAQ (Frequently Asked Quirks)

**Q: Why "gshh"?**  
A: Because `git-shush` was too long, and `gshh` sounds like you’re telling Git to "shhh, just do it."

**Q: Does it work with branches?**  
A: It pushes to your current branch. If you need more control, maybe learn Git properly. (Just kidding… but not really.)

**Q: What if I mess up?**  
A: Same as regular Git—panic, then `git reset --hard`.
